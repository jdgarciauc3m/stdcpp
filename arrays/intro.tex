\section{Introduction}

During the Chicago meeting several options where discussed for \emph{Array of
Runtime Bounds}. These alternatives are well summarized in N3810~\cite{n3810}.

This paper explores into more detail the last option mentioned in N3810 (named
there as \emph{array constructors}. The idea behind is to provide a general way
for defining (possibly) stack allocated arrays.

\section{Problem}

\emph{Variable Length Arrays} (VLAs) have existed in C for some time. However,
the introduction of VLAs in C++ standard as they are has been identified as
problematic.

Several attempts have been made to introduce a similar facility in the C++
programming language. A solution was incorporated in the working draft of C++14
in the Bristol meeting. At the Chicago meeting the committe decided that this
solution was controversial and this part was removed from the working draft. The
committee decided that a separate technical report on \emph{array extensions}
should address this issue.
