\section{Introduction}

During the Chicago meeting several options where discussed for \emph{Array of
Runtime Bounds}. These alternatives are well summarized in N3810~\cite{n3810}.

This paper explores into more detail the last option mentioned in N3810 (named
there as \emph{array constructors}. The idea behind is to provide a general way
for defining (possibly) stack allocated arrays.
