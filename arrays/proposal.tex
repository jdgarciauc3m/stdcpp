\section{Proposal: run-time size bounds}

In this paper we present a proposal of what N3810~\cite{n3810} names as the
\emph{array constructors} proposal which was originally suggested by J. Daniel
Garcia in the \emph{-ext} mailing list. Ellaborations on this idea were later
made by others including Bjarne Stroustrup, Daveed Vandevoorde and Lawrence
Crowl.

The core idea of this proposal is to allow a class to have one or more run-time
bound array data-members. Those array data members will be of unspecified number
of elements. The constructor is responsible for setting the size upon object
construction.

We present two variations of this proposed ideas:

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Inline constructors}: Constructors are required to be inline and the size
of array data members is set in the constructor initialization list.

\item \textbf{Sized constructors}: Constructors specify the size of run-time
bound array data-members as part of their declaration.

\end{itemize}
