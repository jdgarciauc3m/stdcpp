\section{Minimal proposal}

This paper introduces a minimal proposal with a strawman syntax for it.
Thus, syntax here is used only for illustration. Besides, additional
features could be elaborated if there is some agreement on the notions
presented in this paper.

\subsection{Design principles}

This proposal follows the guidance quoted in the introduction of this paper.
Moreover the design of this proposal tries to follow a set of design principles:

\begin{enumerate}
\item An operation contract should allow to express its preconditions and its
postconditions as part of its declaration.
\item Violation of a contract should be handled orthogonally from run-time
errors due to abnormal conditions.
\item Contracts should be well integrated with polymorphism.
\end{enumerate}
