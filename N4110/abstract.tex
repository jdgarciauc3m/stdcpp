\section*{Abstract}

This paper explores the design space for introducing contracts as part of the
interface of functions and types. The goal is to address the problem of
specifying an interface (with special attention to standard library interfaces)
making a clear distinction between a contract violation and an explicitly thrown
exception. Preconditions and postconditions are attached to function
declarations (i.e. to interfaces) rather than to definitions, and are, in
principle, checked before and after a function's definition is entered. No
macros are needed.
