\section{Definitions}

To ensure a common understanding I provide a set of definitions that will be
used in the rest of the paper.

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Error condition}: A condition that when met will lead to an error
from which a program may or may not recover.

\item \textbf{Precondition}: A condition that needs to be satisfied prior to
the execution of a function.

\item \textbf{Postcondition}: A condition that is ensured to be held after the
execution of a function.

\item \textbf{Invariant}: A condition that needs to be satisfied prior to the
execution of a function and is ensured to be held after the execution of a
function.

\item \textbf{Contract}: Set of preconditions, postconditions and invariants
associated to a function.

\item \textbf{Contract violation}: The execution of a function when a
precondition or an invariant is not satisfied before the function or when a
postcondition or invariant is not held after the function execution.

\end{itemize}
