\section{Introduction}

During the Chicago meeting several options were discussed for \emph{Array of
Runtime Bounds}. These alternatives are well summarized in N3810~\cite{n3810}.

This paper explores into more detail the last option mentioned in N3810 (named
there as \emph{array constructors}). The goal is to provide a general way for
defining automatic storage arrays (i.e. stack allocated or side-stack allocated)
whose size is not known at compile time.

\section{Problem}

\emph{Variable Length Arrays} (VLAs) have existed in C since C99~\cite{c99}. However,
the introduction of VLAs in C++ standard as they are, has been identified as
problematic.

Several attempts have been made to introduce a similar facility in the C++
programming language. A solution was incorporated in the working draft of C++14
in the Bristol meeting (N3691~\cite{n3691}). At the Chicago meeting the committe
decided that this solution was controversial and this part was removed from the
working draft (N3797~\cite{n3797}). The committee decided that a separate
technical report on \emph{array extensions} should address this issue.
